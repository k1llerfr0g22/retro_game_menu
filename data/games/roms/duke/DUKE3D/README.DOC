
What's new in Duke Nukem 3D v1.3D?
==================================
* Why version 1.3D and not 1.2?  There was a minor leak of version 1.2, so
  we bumped the version number.  V1.2 is NOT official and if you have it,
  delete it, it's illegal, and get v1.3D.
* The major addition to v1.3D is that the full version of the game is done as
  well.
* X,Y axis sensitivity controls for mouse (in SETUP)
* TEN (Total Entertainment Network) support from SETUP.  NOTE: Go to
  http://www.ten.net for more details on when Duke Nukem 3D will be there.
* New load screen art.
* Ability to record demos from the OPTIONS menu (single or multiplay game)
  NOTE:  In multiplay, the "master" has to select DEMO ON.
* Some new voice sayings.
* F5 - Change Music.  Shift-F5 to select song.
* Multiplay changes:
  - Respawning items markers.  These markers default to ON and can be turned
    on or off.  They mark where items will respawn once gotten.  If the
    Nuke symbol marker is red, an item is 15-30 seconds away, Yellow means
    7-15 seconds and Green means 0-7 seconds (Stick around!).  Experienced
    players might want to play with or without these, but they do add a new
    element of gameplay and help out new players by showing them where the
    items are.
  - Inclusion of DukeMatch-NOSPAWN Mode.  In this mode, nothing respawns
    except the inventory items.  No more running for the next health atom
    as they will be gone once grabbed.  Also, no more hoarding rocket ammo
    and the like.  The resources are scarce and this mode is a more true
    test of skill, as once you get down to a pistol, things get hairy.
  - Co-Op works like NOSPAWN mode.  The weapons stay around, so 8 players
    can all get the Rocket launcher and not have to wait for something.  The
    Co-Op rules work just like NOSPAWN mode where only the inventory items
    respawn.  Also, you get to keep what you have collected from level to
    level.
  - More DukeMatch screams and yells.  The more severe the damage, the more
    extreme the sound.
  - Messages in modem mode work now.  They do not overlap each other anymore.
  - You can type messages with the game paused.  D'oh!  We forgot about that!
  - Mouse turning speed made more like v1.0 where quick 180 flicks are
    easy to do.  Another goof on our part.
  - Better start points on E1L1.  No more unfair roof starts.
* Inventory items like Steroids and HoloDuke now deplete is you are looking
  into a monitor.
* Should sound a little better.  We changed the sound mixing and you should
  get less "crackle" and "pops" from your speakers.
* Smoke trails for rockets.
* Probably some more little things we forgot about.
